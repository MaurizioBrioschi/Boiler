Boiler
======

Boiler is a very easy MVC framework for PHP 5.3+.
Very light, very easy to install and learn: **the only thing you must know is how to write code in PHP**.

Installation
=======
 * Just download last released file .zip, here in github (so you are sure it's work, master realease is always under pressure) file and unzip it in your root directory web site
 * With git from command line type and it will be download in the current directory: git clone https://github.com/ridesoft/Boiler 

Note
=======

This is my personal framework, used for years (2006-2010) to develop web applications and now is time to make it public.
Probably is to fix, explain and to make more easy... 
But it's an exemple of an MVC basic framework.
